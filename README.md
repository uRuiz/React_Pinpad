# Getting Started (PIN PAD APP)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was created for Acid Tango code challenge. It implements a pin pad. The code to unlock the pin pad is 2012 (Acid Tango foundation year)

## Requeriments

- Buttons should work with either touch or clicks
- The pin should be hidden except for the last number
- Hardcode somewhere in the code right PIN (which eventually will be checked against an API)
- The pin is always max 4 digits long
- When the user inputs 4 digits the pin is checked
- If the inserted PIN is correct the screen displays OK and the pin is reset
- If the inserted PIN is wrong the screen displays ERROR and the pin is reset

## Bonus requirements

- Usage of TypeScript
- After 3 wrong attempts the pin pad locks for 30 secs, showing LOCKED on the display
